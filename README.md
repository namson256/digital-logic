The basis of contemporary computer systems is digital logic, which focuses on the representation and manipulation of data using binary digits (bits). This area of study examines the planning and construction of digital circuits, which use flip-flops and gates in combination to carry out logical operations. Boolean algebra, truth tables, sequential circuits, and logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) are important ideas. Digital logic is essential to comprehending how computers handle and store data, and it is used extensively in computer architecture, digital signal processing, and electronic design, among other fields. A framework for developing and perfecting the electronic parts that make up the core of digital technology can be found by studying digital logic.
